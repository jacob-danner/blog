            <h2>About the blog: </h2>
            <p>This blog was created as part of an independent study where I read research papers. I've learned a ton! Special thanks to Dr. Urness for supervising this independent study and allowing this to happen.</p>
            <h2> Ways to improve this in the future:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I want to improve the design work. CSS isn't my speciality, but I could definitely work to add more color and a better user experience.</li>
                <li>Reading more papers and writing more posts</li>
                <li>I plan to learn more about AWS and cloud computing in general soon. I would really like to figure out the optimal way to deploy this app and then do it right.</li>
                <li>I plan to flesh this site out to be something of a portfolio</li>
            </ul>
